Hi this is [biliartag](https://github.com/billiartag) and you can call me by Billy or Cosmas. I am a Computer Science graduate who currently working as a Software Engineer, and currently working on Laravel and Flutter projects.

## 💼 Career

Graduated by late 2021, I've been working for 2+ years as Software Engineer. Currently working as a Software Engineer at Tancorp (PT. Tancorp Abadi Nusantara) since 2024. Building projects using Laravel and Flutter applications.

> Tancorp (2024 - present)

Currently working here as a Software Engineer(well, more as a real Full Stack Engineer) from the start of 2024. Most of the projects ae Laravel and Flutter projects, and not closing any opportunity to learn other things. Have handful number of projects to handle, and counting more LOL. Some good remarks such as publishing app to Apple's App Store and Google Play Store from scratch, manage LXC containers in Proxmox to host Laravel projects using Debian, and many more...

> Techanic (2022 - 2023)

Hired at Techanic as a Full Stack Engineer and assigned for Laravel and Flutter (at the end, Flutter is the main job for me LOL), from mid 2022 to Q3 of 2023 (for a year and few months). We built 3 Flutter apps and successfuly published them on Apple's App Store and Google Play Store, with probably 100+ customers(??) were using the system. Terminated due to company's funding problem. It was a solid team in my opinion (●'◡'●).

> Institut Sains dan Teknologi Terpadu Surabaya (iSTTS) (2021-2022)

Working for iSTTS (my campus) during internship period, about 5 months, built a website using Laravel stack. Visit the website [here](https://training.istts.ac.id/), eventhough it is no longer used anymore :pleading_face:.
